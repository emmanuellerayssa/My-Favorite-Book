# My Favorite Book Project

## Description

This little project helps you create a simple web page using HTML & CSS.The goal here is to play with the HTML Elements and CSS slectors to create a beautiful web page where I present to you my favorite book.
If you're a beginner, this project is for you. If you're not into books, that's ok. Just make this project your own and present whatever it is that you're interested in.
Here's what my web page looks like:
