        <p>Hi Guys, I have the pleasure to present to you one of my favorite books of all time.</p>
        <p>This book is very dear to my heart for so many reasons, one being that it was written by my favorite author Mrs. <span style="color: rgb(104, 4, 90); font-weight: bolder;">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.</span></p>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I'm going to tell you more about  <span style="color: rgb(104, 4, 90); font-weight: bolder;">Purple Hibiscus.</span></p>

            <legend>The Story</legend>
            <p>Imagine growing up in a house where your dad is basically a dictator, but instead of a throne, he rules with Bible verses and terrifying punishments. That’s Kambili’s life in Purple Hibiscus.</p>
            <p>She’s a shy, thoughtful fifteen-year-old living under her father Eugene’s strict rules. He’s a local hero on the outside, generous, respected, super religious, but at home, he’s scary and controlling.</p>
            <p>Everything changes when Kambili and her brother Jaja visit their aunt Ifeoma, who’s basically the cool opposite of their dad.</p>
            <p>Her house is full of laughter, independence, and chaos (the good kind), and she even grows these magical <span style="color: rgb(104, 4, 90); font-weight: bolder;">purple hibiscus flowers, symbols of freedom and courage.</span></p>
            <p>For the first time, Kambili sees what life could be like outside her father’s shadow.</p>
            <p>The story is about <span style="color: rgb(104, 4, 90); font-weight: bolder;">finding your voice, surviving abuse, and daring to grow your own “purple hibiscus” even when life is harsh.</span> It’s dramatic, heartbreaking, sometimes funny, and ultimately a story about hope, rebellion, and the messy, beautiful ways families shape us.</p>
